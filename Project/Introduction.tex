This paper presents some of the initial steps in automating image recognition of individual North Atlantic Right Whales.
It will conduct some experiments with the purpose of investigate how well it is possible to correctly classifying the individual whales, with relatively little preprocessing using two different classification algorithms.

The North Atlantic Right Whale is an critical endangered species. 
This paper will try to contribute to the major task of processing the data gathered by monitoring the population size and trends by automating the identification of the individual whales.
