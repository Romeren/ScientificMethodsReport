The problem originates from a website called kaggle\footnote{\url{http://kaggle.com}} which organizes competitions within the field of data science. The competitions are normally provided to help companies and organizations to use machine learning and computer vision to solve some of their real world problems. The companies and organizations provide a cash reward to some of the more difficult problems, to the people who solve it best. The competition for this project can be found at the kaggle website \cite{kaggle:competition}.

The introduction introduced the problem with the current practice in the protection program of the North Atlantic Right Whale. Further did it show that the local authorities and institution have been provided with a centralized knowledge system maintaining data of each individual whale.
The problem is that it is too time consuming and might also be inaccurate to use.
From this problem the following problem formulation for this project have been made:

\begin{center}
	\emph{To which extent is it possible to lower error rate in automation of correctly identify individual North Atlantic Right Whales through the use of image recognition?}
\end{center}
