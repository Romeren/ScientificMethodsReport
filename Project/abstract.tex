This report describes the method of using the machine learning techniques Random Forest and Neural Network to classify individual North Atlantic Right Whales from a dataset provided by the kaggle.com website. Clustering and down sampling is used for preprocessing of the dataset, where all unnecessary water from the images are removed.

The results are worse than expected as only the Random Forest without using the preprocessed data performs significantly better than random selection. 

It is proposed that using different preprocessing techniques like uniform the images so all whales face have same direction and position in all images, alternatively it could use feature extraction instead of looking at pixels.
