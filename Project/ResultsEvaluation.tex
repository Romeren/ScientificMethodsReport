This section explains the results of the project in \ref{subsec:results} and evaluate on the results in \ref{subsec:evaluation}.

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsec:results}
The Results section contains results for both the preprocessing and the two classification algorithms and their performance.

\subsubsection{Preprocessing}

\subsubsection{Random Forest}
The Results for Random Forest is split into two sections. As there has been conducted classification for both data which was just resized and data which has been additionally preprocessed before resizing.

\paragraph{The Resized Data} 
Contains the results which is shown in \ref{fig:??}. As 


\subsubsection{Neural Network}
