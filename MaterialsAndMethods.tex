\subsection{Hypotheses}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Random Forest algorithm has a higher frequency of correctly classifying whales than Random Selection from images
\item Deep Neural Network algorithm has a higher frequency of correctly classifying whales than Random Selection from images
\item Having the knowledge of whales position in a given image increase the frequency of correctly classification of whales with Deep Neural Network
\item Having the knowledge of whales position in a given image increase the frequency of correctly classification of whales with Random Forest
\end{enumerate}
