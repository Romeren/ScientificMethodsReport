\subsection{Problem Formulation}
The introduction introduced the problem with the current practise in the protection program of the North Atlantic Right Whale. Further did it show that the local authorities and institution have been provided with a centralized knowledge system maintaining data of each individual whale.
The problem is that it is too time consuming and might also be inaccurate to use.
From this problem the following problem formulation for this project have been made:

\begin{center}
\textit{To which extent is it possible to lower error rate in automation of correctly identify individual North Atlantic Right Whales through the use of image recognition?}
