The problem originates from a website called kaggle\footnote{\url{http://kaggle.com}} which organizes competitions in the field of data science. The competitions are normally provided to help companies and organizations to use machine learning and computer vision to solve some of their real world problems. The companies and organizations provide a cash reward to some of the more difficult problems. The competition for this project can be found at the kaggle website \cite{kaggle:competition}.

From this problem the following problem formulation for this project have been made:
