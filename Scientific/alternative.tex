Since we have rejected tree out of four of the initial hypothesises, we therefore must accept the alternative hypothesis for the specific setting.
These hypothesis are:
\begin{itemize}
\item For the second hypothesis; Neural Network algorithm have same or lower frequency of correctly classifying whales than Random Selection
\item For the third hypothesis; Having knowledge of a whales position in an image does not increase the frequency of correctly classifying whales with the Neural Network Algorithm
\item For the fourth hypothesis; Having knowledge of a whales position in an image does not increase the frequency of correctly classifying whales with the Random Forest Algorithm.  
\end{itemize}

For first hypothesis which we fail to reject the alternative hypothesis would be:
Random Forest have same or lower frequency of correctly classifying whales than Random Selection.
