This paper presents some of the initial steps in automating image recognition of individual North Atlantic Right Whales.
It will conduct some experiments with the purpose of investigate how well it is possible to correctly classifying the individual whales, with relatively little preprocessing using two different classification algorithms, Neural Network and Random Forest.

The North Atlantic Right Whale is a critically endangered species. 
This paper will try to contribute to the major task of processing the data gathered by monitoring the population size and trends by automating the identification of the individual whales.

To identify a whale from an image, the image is first cropped down to fit the whale, thereby reducing the amount of water dimensions in the image. After this the image is scaled down to thumbnail size and smoothed. this is done to all the images. The set of images is then split into two, one training set the other a test set.
With the training set a model is trained to classify a given whale on an image as one of the already know whales.
With the trained model the test set is used to verify that the classification model is generalizable enough to work independently from the training set.
